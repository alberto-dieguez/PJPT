# PJPT
Notes PJPT Exam. Practical Ethical Hacking.

Hello future hackers! If you were on the Linux or Python sections of the course and have noticed they have disappeared, do not fret.

As part of our free tier launch, we have removed these sections due to redundancy. Should you wish to go over Linux, you can find that course [here](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/linux-fundamentals). You can find the Python course [here](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/programming-100-fundamentals).

Happy hacking!
