## A Day in the Life of an Ethical Hacker
Assessment:
 - **External Network Pentest**:
 Assessing an organization's security from outside looking in. Based on OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) Example: Who are their employees? What is their email format? Usually from 32h to 40h and 8h to 16h for the report.

 - **Internal Network Pentest**:
 Assessing an organization's security from inside of the network. Focuses on Active Directory attacks. Usually from 32h to 40h and 8h to 16h for the report.

 - **Web Application Pentest**:
 Assessing an organization's web application security. Focuses on web-based attacks and OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project). Usually from 32h to 40h and 8h to 16h for the report.

- **Wireless Pentest**:
Assessing an organization's wireless network security. Based on guest vs WPA2-PSK vs WPA2 Enterprise. Usually 4h to 8h per SSID and 2h to 4h for the report.
